# Hearst Training: JS Utility functions
> This lesson focuses on creating and understanding common and useful utility functions in JS
* Difficulty: 2/5
* Environment: everywhere JS runs
* Modules: 3
* Days: 1


## Why do you need to know this?
These functions are the core functions that exists hundreds of times in any given code base rather you use it or not. Knowing how these functions work and when to use them gives you more prepared tools to use to author better code. You should never have to write a `for loop` ever again!

## Instructions
Like all training, this lesson is broken down into modules. Each module having it's own branch and solution branch. All modules go in order of learning. Here are a list of modules with their descriptions:

* **module-1**
  * `each` and `map` functions.
* **module-2**
  * `filter` and `reduce` functions.
* **module-3**
  * `every` and `flatten` functions.

## Objectives
* get all tests to pass without breaking or changing other tests.

## Gotchas
Because we are creating array functions, all the equivelant native methods have been disabled, and if you try to use them, you will get a failing test and an error that will tell you that you are cheating. That will also be posted to your assesment tracking. For instance, when creating the `each` function, the `[].forEach()` had been disabled. So if you true to use `.forEach()` inside the implementation of your `each` function, you're cheating and it won't work :sunglasses:
